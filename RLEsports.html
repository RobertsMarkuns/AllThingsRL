        <p> <b>The Rocket League Championship Series (RLCS)</b> is a annual Rocket League video game tournament series produced by Psyonix,
            the game's developer. It consists of qualification rounds in North America, South America, Europe, and Oceania,
            and culminates in a twelve-team playoff bracket with four teams from North America and Europe,
            and two teams from Oceania and South America. The qualification rounds are played as an online round-robin tournament and the finals are played in different cities,
            the most recent being in Madrid at the end of season 8 in 2019.
            History: Psyonix had observed the popularity of Rocket League matches on Twitch and other live streaming platforms,
            and were looking to use the game more in eSports by February 2016. In March 2016, Psyonix announced the first Rocket League Championship Series;
            the finals took place in August 2016 with a $55,000 prize pool. The second season of the championship series took place in December 2016 with a $125,000 prize pool.
            A third series began in March 2017, with the $300,000 prize pool finals taking place three months later. In this season, two teams from the oceanic region were also invited to compete.
            A second division, the Rocket League Rival Series (RLRS), was added in Season 4.
            The two teams finishing at the bottom of the RLCS and the two teams finishing at the top of the RLRS for each region play each other in a promotion tournament at the end of the season to determine if teams are promoted or relegated.
            Season 6 started in September 2018 and featured a million dollar prize pool. For Season 7, Psyonix introduced South America as a new region.</p>
